/**********************
Architecture
**********************/

3 seperate javascripts. 1) for GUI 2) Library file and 3) process the data.

GUI is seperated from the data.(dailyreport.html)
data as been stored in to the dictionary  object using app.js file

jsDict.js file to created a  new dictionay object. which has some basic methods. like add, update , remove. 


/**********************
Process
**********************/
When dailyreport.html page is being loaded it call the getJson Function and pass the URL paramater to it.

getJson function fetch the data asynchronously. When packet arrives it makes a function call(assignData) and release the data. assignData function sort the data and process it and sotre it in to the dictionary object.

Now we check the if dictionary is empty or not. If it is empty, than make a evencall and load the data into it. 

Next call the displayData fucntion to display the data on GUI. 



/**********************
Improvements
**********************/

Dynamically loading the dictioary data. e.g. display first 150 entry when scroll reaches bottom load another 150 an on.
